From the start to the fore, they paced through rough terrains and crossed the finish line steadily with sheer strength and agility. Their journey hasn't been smooth, but with utter perseverance, they stand in the hall of fame. So at TheTKMShows latest series Club99 , we bring to you the race stories of Baja and lot more greasy tales of SAE TKMCE . Prick up your ears to the enthralling accounts of  James Sebastian and Jishnu Periya, two of the founders of SAE TKMCE (2017 batch) along with Alin Amrulla (2019 batch) and Jishnu G Nair (2020 batch).",
